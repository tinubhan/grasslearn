- Story about castle with html css js and then with React js (facebook)

o What is frontend?

```bash
 The frontend, also known as the client-side, refers to the part of a web application or website that users interact with directly. It includes the user interface, design, and everything users see and interact with on their screens.
```

o How frontend works?

```bash
User Interaction: The frontend works by taking user input and displaying the results. When users interact with a website or application, their actions trigger events that the frontend interprets and responds to.

Technologies: HTML provides the structure, CSS handles the styling, and JavaScript adds interactivity. These three technologies work together to create a seamless user experience.
```

o What is reactjs?

```bash
Definition: React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and build interactive, single-page applications efficiently.
Component-Based: React is component-based, meaning you can break down your UI into independent, reusable pieces, making development more modular and maintainable.
```

o Benefits of reactjs.

```bash
Reusability:  Components can be reused throughout the application, saving development time.
VirtualDOM:  React uses a virtual DOM for efficient rendering, enhancing performance.
Declarative Syntax: Writing UIs becomes more intuitive with a declarative syntax, making code more predictable and easier to understand.
One-Way Data Binding: Maintains a unidirectional data flow, reducing unexpected side effects.
Large Community: A vast community and ecosystem of libraries and tools for support and extension.
```

o How reacts works? o Diff between virtual dom and real dom? o Diff between
library & framework? o Who developed reactjs? o Latest version of reactjs?
